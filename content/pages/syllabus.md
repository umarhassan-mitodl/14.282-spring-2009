Description
-----------

This course in organizational economics prepares doctoral students for further study in the field. The course introduces the classic papers and some recent research. The material is organized into the following modules:

*   Module 1: Boundaries of the firm
*   Module 2: Employment in organizations
*   Module 3: Decision-making in organizations
*   Module 4: Structures and processes in organizations

Each class session covers a few leading papers.

This course was joint-taught between faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University. The Harvard course is _Economics 2670 Organizational Economics_.

Prerequisites
-------------

The prerequisites are first-year graduate microeconomics (_Economics 2010a Economic Theory_ and _2010b Economic Theory_ at Harvard or the _14.121-14.124 Microeconomic Theory I-IV_ sequence at MIT). In addition students should be familiar and comfortable with the material on incentives and control discussed in the following readings:

Gibbons, Robert. "Incentives Between Firms (and Within)." _Management Science_ 51 (2005): 2-17 (sections 2-4).

———. "Four Formal(izable) Theories of the Firm?" _Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization_ 58 (2005): 202-247 (section 2).

Deliverables
------------

There are three deliverables for credit in the course. The first is a set of three short **model-development essays** , corresponding to the class sessions devoted to discussing case studies (Ses #7, #9, and #20). There are also cases (marked by "C") in some other class sessions; one such case can be the basis for one model-development essay.

In addition to the model-development essays, there are two other requirements: a **review essay** on one of the draft chapters of _The Handbook of Organizational Economics_ (marked by "H") and a **final paper** on any topic of interest to you relating to the material in the course.
